You are building the TISAverse Visual Composer — a web-based rendering engine for children's educational workbooks.

## YOUR MISSION
Transform structured markdown files into beautiful, print-ready A4 workbook pages for children ages 5-11.

## THE PRODUCT
- TISA MBA: 10 workbooks teaching economics/business through fairy tales
- Each workbook: 10 lessons
- Each lesson: 13 components (story, glossary, 6 owl tasks, test, mind map, homework, assessment)
- All content stored as markdown with YAML frontmatter

## FILES I'M GIVING YOU (Read in order!)
1. `_curriculum_master.md` — All workbooks, owls, structure defined
2. `_design_system.md` — Visual rules, grid, typography, colors
3. `_page_type_library.md` — **YOUR IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE** (CSS specs for every page type)
4. `lesson-02-money/` folder — 13 test files with real content

## CRITICAL DESIGN RULES
1. **Purple Anchor:** EVERY page has #6B3FA0 bar at bottom (12mm height) — this is NON-NEGOTIABLE
2. **A4 Format:** 210mm × 297mm, margins 15mm top/left/right, 20mm bottom
3. **Level Colors:** Each grade has a primary color for headers/accents (NOT for bottom bar)
4. **Six Owls:** Each owl task uses its own color scheme (defined in curriculum_master)
5. **Child-Friendly:** Min 11pt text, 1.5 line spacing, lots of writing space

## BUILD ORDER
1. Base page shell (purple bar + content area)
2. Story page renderer
3. Glossary page renderer  
4. 6 Owl task renderers
5. Test, Mind Map, Homework, Assessment pages
6. PDF export

## KEY INSIGHT
The system is MODULAR. Once you build the renderers, new lessons (same file structure) render automatically. No code changes needed for new content.

Start by reading `GEMINI_START_HERE.md` for the full briefing, then `_page_type_library.md` for implementation specs.

Let's build something magical! 🚀

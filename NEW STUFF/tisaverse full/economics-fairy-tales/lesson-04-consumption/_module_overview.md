## 📍 Story Synopsis

> King Luminar is thrilled! The Kingdom of Finance has learned to make goods. But now there's a new problem: people have things, but they don't know how to USE them wisely!
>
> Some people are buying things they don't need. Others can't figure out what's most important. The kingdom needs help understanding CONSUMPTION!
>
> King Luminar writes to the Team of Innovators asking for help to teach people about needs vs wants, and how to choose wisely.

**Key Plot Points:**

## 🔗 Cross-References

**Builds on:**
- Lesson 2: Money (what we use to buy things)
- Lesson 3: Production (what is made)

**Leads to:**
- Lesson 5: Trade & Market (buying and selling)
- Lesson 6: Wealth (accumulating resources)

---

## 📝 Teacher Notes

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "What's the difference between something you NEED and something you WANT?"
2. "Why do we need food before we can think about making friends?"
3. "Can you be happy without having everything you want?"

**Real-World Connections:**
- Family shopping lists (needs vs wants)
- Pocket money decisions
- Birthday wish lists (prioritising)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- All wants are bad (wants are fine after needs are met!)
- Expensive = better (not always true)
- Needs are the same for everyone (they vary!)

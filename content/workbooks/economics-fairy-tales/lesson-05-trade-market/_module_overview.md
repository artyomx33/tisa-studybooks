## 📍 Story Synopsis

> King Luminar decided to purchase foreign goods for his kingdom. The residents had many requests — exotic fruits from distant lands, beautiful fabrics from Cloud Kingdom, and sparkling gems from Gem Land!
>
> But the King realised he needed to understand TRADE — how buying and selling works between kingdoms. He needed to learn about MARKETS, SUPPLY and DEMAND, and how to make good deals!
>
> With the help of Rabbit Moss and Squirrel Twig, the kingdom set out to learn the secrets of trade!

**Key Plot Points:**
- King Luminar wants foreign goods
- Discovers the need for trade between kingdoms
- Introduction to markets and exchanges
- Learning about what makes goods valuable

**Characters Featured:**
- 👑 King Luminar (wants to trade with other kingdoms)
- 🐰 Rabbit Moss (helper)
- 🐿️ Squirrel Twig (helper)
- 🦉 Owl Remembery (at the Market of Knowledge)

## 🔗 Cross-References

**Builds on:**
- Lesson 2: Money (currency for trade)
- Lesson 3: Production (what is made to sell)
- Lesson 4: Consumption (buying and using)

**Leads to:**
- Lesson 6: Wealth (accumulating from trade)
- Lesson 9: Entrepreneurship (starting a business)

---

## 📝 Teacher Notes

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "What's something you can buy at a market that you can't buy at a shopping centre?"
2. "If the price of chocolate goes up, what might you buy instead?"
3. "Why do Christmas trees cost more in December?"

**Real-World Connections:**
- Family shopping trips
- Farmer's markets vs supermarkets
- Seasonal pricing (ice cream in summer, hot chocolate in winter)

**Key Concepts to Emphasise:**
- Substitute goods: Can REPLACE each other (tea/coffee, butter/margarine)
- Complementary goods: Go TOGETHER (bread+butter, toothbrush+toothpaste)
- Supply ↑ = Price ↓ (lots available = cheaper)
- Demand ↑ = Price ↑ (everyone wants it = more expensive)

## 📝 Teacher Notes

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "What businesses do you see in your neighbourhood?"
2. "What problem does a grocery store solve?"
3. "Would you like to start your own business someday? What would it be?"

**Real-World Connections:**
- Local shops and businesses
- Family businesses (do any students' parents own businesses?)
- Famous entrepreneurs (age-appropriate examples)
- School "businesses" (bake sales, craft fairs)

**Key Concepts to Emphasise:**
- **Entrepreneurs SOLVE PROBLEMS** — Every business exists because it helps people
- **Risk vs Reward** — Entrepreneurs take risks hoping for rewards
- **Value Creation** — Businesses create things people WANT or NEED
- **Resources** — Every business needs the right tools, materials, and people

**TISA Connection:**
This is THE core TISA lesson! Entrepreneurship is in TISA's DNA. Emphasise that EVERYONE can be an entrepreneur — it starts with seeing a problem and wanting to solve it!

## 📍 Story Synopsis

> The Enchanted Toy Workshop in the Kingdom of Finance is in TROUBLE! 🧸
>
> This magical place, known for making the most wonderful toys in all the land, has a problem: the workers are NOT following their roles!
>
> To create magical toys, the workshop needs sparkling star dust and 10 barrels of rainbow glue. The glue is mixed in enchanted tree hollows under the moonlight to make it magical.
>
> But chaos has broken out! Painters are trying to mix glue. Glue mixers are trying to carve wood. Carvers are trying to package toys!
>
> King Luminar needs YOUR help! Can you organise the workers, guide the glue preparation process, and save the Enchanted Toy Workshop?

**Key Plot Points:**
- Toy workshop in crisis — workers doing wrong jobs
- Each section has specialists who are best at ONE thing
- When everyone does their best task, magic happens!
- Introduction to teamwork and efficiency

**Characters Featured:**
- 👑 King Luminar (needs help organising)
- 🧸 Toy Workshop Workers (5 sections, 10 workers each)
- Various specialists (painters, carvers, glue mixers, packagers)

## 📝 Teacher Notes

**Discussion Prompts:**
1. "What happens when everyone tries to do everything?"
2. "What are YOU best at? What's your specialisation?"
3. "Why do doctors focus on medicine instead of also building houses?"

**Real-World Connections:**
- School staff (teachers teach, cooks cook, cleaners clean)
- Family roles (who cooks? who cleans? who drives?)
- Factory assembly lines

**Key Concepts to Emphasise:**
- **Division of Labour** = Splitting work so each person does their best task
- **Specialisation** = Becoming really good at ONE thing
- **Efficiency** = Getting more done in less time when specialised
- **Teamwork** = Everyone contributes their special skill

**Classic Economics Connection:**
This lesson teaches Adam Smith's famous "pin factory" concept — when workers specialise (one person draws wire, one cuts, one sharpens), they produce FAR more than if each person made entire pins alone!

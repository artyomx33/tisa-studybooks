>
> King Luminar asked his helpers, Moss the wise rabbit and Twig the cheerful squirrel: "What can we do?"
>
> 🐰 Moss replied: "These are RISKS, Your Majesty. We should INSURE the kingdom!"

## 📝 Teacher Notes

3. "Have your parents ever mentioned insurance?"

**Real-World Connections:**
- Car insurance (parents)
- Home insurance
- Health insurance / NHS
- Travel insurance for holidays

**Key Concepts to Emphasise:**
- **Risk** = Something bad MIGHT happen (but might not!)
- **Insurance** = Pay a little now to be protected later
- **Prevention** = We can reduce risks with careful behaviour
- **Different needs** = Different people need different insurance

**Safety Note:**
This lesson discusses risks but should NOT make children anxious. Frame it positively: "We can PROTECT ourselves and plan ahead!"
